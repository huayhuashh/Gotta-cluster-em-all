# Gotta-cluster-em-all
Discovering the power of unsupervised learning by clustering Pokémons in R. Used techniques include **K-means clustering** and **Hierarchical clustering** complemented with **Principal component analysis**. Introductory training session for the Data Science Cluster at my previous employer [Oxera](https://www.oxera.com/).

## Context
I created this easy intro on unsupervised learning from scratch as part of an internal Data Science competition at Oxera. The format of this shared learning experience was 3 teams, 3 datasets, one challenge. The aim was to explore the applications of unsupervised learning in teams while working on data from Google Android users, London subway commuters, and balance sheets of European banks. This starter code helped to create a level playing field for the participants of the competition.

## Usage
The R Markdown file allows you to start off with unsupervised learning in a structured format right away. The pre-loaded Pokémon dataset contains 800 observations with many attributes (e.g. attack, defense, speed). More information on the evolution of Pokemon data across different generations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon).

## Format
Both the raw R Markdown and the printed pdf output are available in the repo.
