# Gotta-cluster-em-all
Discovering the power of ***Unsupervised learning*** by clustering Pokémons in R. Used techniques include **K-means clustering** and **Hierarchical clustering** complemented with **Principal component analysis**. Introductory training session for the Data Science Cluster at my previous employer [Oxera](https://www.oxera.com/).

## Context
I created this easy intro on unsupervised learning from scratch as part of an internal Data Science competition at Oxera. This starter code helped to level the playing field for the participants of the competition.

Format: 3 teams, 3 datasets, one challenge.

Aim: explore the applications of unsupervised learning in teams while working on data from Google Android users, London subway commuters, and balance sheets of European banks. 

## Starting point
The R Markdown file allows you to start off with unsupervised learning in a structured format right away. The pre-loaded dataset contains detailed information on 800 pokémons (e.g. attack, defense, speed). More information on the vast array of Pokémons across different generations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon).

Both the raw R Markdown and the printed pdf output are available in the repo.

## Next steps
 This is starter code – feel encouraged to tweak the code and data used as you go.
